# smart-splits.vscode

Inspired by the [smart-splits.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim) Neovim plugin by Mat Jones, this VSCode extension aims to bring smart and intuitive split pane navigation and resizing functionality to VSCode. Instead of the traditional "wider/narrower/taller/shorter" resizing model, this extension adopts a more natural "left/right/up/down" approach.
